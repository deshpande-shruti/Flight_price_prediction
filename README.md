# Flight_price_prediction

## Introduction: 

Flight prices can be hard to guess, we might see a price today and check the price of the  exact same flight tomorrow. Here, we take on a challenge. As data scientists, we will prove that given the right data anything can be predicted.

## Problem Statement

Here you are provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between various cities.
It is a regression problem where we are predicting the flight prices. This is hackathon problem statement which involves lot of EDA and Feature Engineering as most of the predictors are categorical variables.
